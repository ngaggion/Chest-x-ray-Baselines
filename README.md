# Baselines for Chest x-ray Landmark Segmentation Dataset.

Baselines are taken from our latest work and trained under both lungs and heart segmentation and only lungs segmentation.\
Results are available on Jupyter notebooks, train and test subsets are provided on .txt files and training scripts are available.

## Installation:

First create the anaconda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate it with:
```
conda activate torch
```

In case the installation fails, you can build your own enviroment.
